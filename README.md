# Howto For Creating a Digital Scanner for the Raspberry Pi 4

## Introduction

This guide will show you how to create a digital, trunked Raspberry Pi scanner using an RTL SDR and SDR Trunk software.  Top of the line digital scanners cost upwards of $500-$600, this project will cost about half of that with a lot of flexability in how it can be implmented. 

My goal with this was to create as close to an all-in-one solution as possible, where there was only one thing to plugin and it is fairly portable.

## Step One Obtain Parts

Here are a list of parts you'll need, some of these things can be obtained at Microcenter for lower prices so if you have one near you, check there first.

1. A Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 4 Gb of RAM (8 Gb works too if you'd like): https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X
2. A high quality power supply, I like this one (you can get one without a switch for $1 less): https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X
3. A good cooling fan, I used this one as we'll be overclocking the Pi and we will need to keep it cool: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZV1LLWK
4. Optional: The above cooler has a fan with LED's on it, if you don't want to deal with that you can get this fan as a replacement: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NEMGCIA
