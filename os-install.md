# Operating System and Software Install

1. Now that the case has been assembled and the OS is installed on the card, it's time to boot up for the first time.  Plug in and allow the Pi to boot up and you will see a log in prompt, but do not log in yet as it is setting up WiFi, wait until it reboots first and then log in with username ubuntu and password ubuntu.  It will prompt you to change your password at this point.  Once this is done do an update:
        
        sudo apt update
